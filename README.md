# lzma-sdk

This is a fork of the [7-Zip LZMA SDK](https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html) version 18.05 with changes to the SfxSetup module for inclusion in our installers.

The LZMA SDK is placed in the public domain and we'd like to keep our fork that way. In jurisdictions where this isn't possible, you can consider it to be MIT licensed.
